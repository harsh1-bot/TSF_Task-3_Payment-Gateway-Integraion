        <p>Bal Niketan is a "Home" for orphan, destitute and abandoned children from Haryana and adjoining areas and was established on 2nd of October, 1983. It was the brainchild of its Founder President late Shri J.D. Sharma IAS (retd.) who was an eminent educationist and a former Vice Chancellor of Jammu University. Inspired by the words of Swami Vivekananda, "They Alone Live Who Live for Others", late Shri Sharma conceived the noble idea of establishing this "HOME" to help such children to grow and live with dignity as good citizens and ultimately to stand on their own feet through education and vocational training arranged by Bal Niketan.

          It is located in Sector-2,<br> Panchkula on 1.5 acre plot with a covered area of over 12,000 sq.ft. and having a strength of around 55 children.

        <br><p>In India and across the world, Save the Children works on-ground – every day and especially, in times of crisis. Our pioneering programs address children’s unique needs; giving them a healthy start, an opportunity to learn as well as protection from harm. When crisis strikes, we are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We are the outspoken champions for children, ensuring that their voices are heard and their issues are given top priority. Drawing on a century of leading expertise, we take on the toughest challenges, facing the hardest-to-reach children – especially those unfairly excluded from the world’s progress.</p>
